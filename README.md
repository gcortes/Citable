# Citable
An Angular Dart package that displays a bibliographic entry when the cursor is placed over the citation.

Citable is works just like a tooltip. The important difference is that it's designed to simplify the effort of the page author in adding them. Once the package is intalled the addtion of citations and bibliographic entries is a two step process all withing the target html page. The formatting of the citation and the bibliographic entry can be completely customized through CSS changes.
## Caveat
Citation CSS is inconsistently applied in Chrome and Chromium at this point. An issue has been opened. Is it known to work in Sarfari and Firefow on OS X.
